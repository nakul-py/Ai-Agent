## Environment Configuration

To set up the environment variables for the project, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Locate the `.env.sample` File

The `.env.sample` file contains a template for the required environment variables. It is located in the following directories:

- **Frontend**: `ai-Ticket-Frontend/.env.sample`
- **Backend**: `ai-Ticket-Assistant/.env.sample`

### Step 2: Create a `.env` File

1. Copy the `.env.sample` file to a new file named `.env` in the same directory.

   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file and replace the placeholders with your actual values.

   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1. Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholders with your actual values.

   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```

2. Save the changes.

### Step 4: Verify Environment Variables

1. Open the `.env` file and verify that the environment variables are correctly configured.

   ```bash
   cat .env
   ```

2. If the environment variables are correctly configured, you can proceed to the next step.

### Step 5: Start the Backend

1. Navigate to the root directory of the project.

   ```bash
   cd ai-Ticket-Assistant
   ```

2. Run the `npm run dev` command to start the application.

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Once the backend is running, you can proceed to the next step.

### Step 6: Start the Frontend

   ```bash
   cd ai-Ticket-Frontend
   ```

2. Run the `npm run dev` command to start the application.
